#Goes to the low goal.  If the robot is on the right side of the origin, it goes to the right low goal.
#If it is on the left side of the origin, it goes to the left goal.  To do this, it first runs a 
#"Turn Path" command at _1 degrees/sec, _2 deg/sec/sec, then does a "Drive Path" command at _3 in/sec, _4 in/sec/sec
